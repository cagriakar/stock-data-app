        Once upon a time, in a far-off land, there was a very lazy king who spent all day lounging on his throne. One
        day, his advisors came to him with a problem: the kingdom was running out of money.
      </p>
      <p>
        The king thought long and hard, and finally came up with a brilliant plan: he would tax the jokes in the
        kingdom.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jokester began sneaking into the castle in the middle of the night and leaving jokes all over the place: under
        the king's pillow, in his soup, even in the royal toilet. The king was furious, but he couldn't seem to stop
        Jokester.
      </p>
      <p>
        And then, one day, the people of the kingdom discovered that the jokes left by Jokester were so funny that they
        couldn't help but laugh. And once they started laughing, they couldn't stop.
